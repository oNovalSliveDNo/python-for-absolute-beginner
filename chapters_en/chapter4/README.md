# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 4 â€” Strings, for-loop, range, tuples, indexing and slicing

In this chapter, basic sequences in Python are explored: strings and tuples. It demonstrates how to use the `for` loop, the `range()` function, as well as indexing, slicing, and basic operations on strings and tuples.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics

- Working with strings: iteration, indexing, slicing
- The `for` loop and its use with strings and other sequences
- The `range()` function and its parameters (start, stop, step)
- Removing characters from strings (creating new strings)
- Using `in` and `len()` to analyze text
- Tuples: creation, index access, slicing, concatenation
