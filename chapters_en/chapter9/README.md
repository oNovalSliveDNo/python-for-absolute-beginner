# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 9 â€” Object Interaction and Inheritance in OOP

This chapter explores the expansion of object-oriented programming in Python through object interaction and inheritance. It shows how to create class hierarchies, override methods, use modularity, and apply inheritance to reuse code and build flexible systems.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics

* Object interaction
* Object composition and association
* Inheritance and class extension
* Method overriding
* Working with modules and importing code
* Creating simple game scenarios with objects

## ðŸš€ Files

* `alien_dies.py` â€” demonstrates object interaction (player and alien)
* `playing_cards.py` â€” implementation of card and hand classes, demonstrates composition
* `playing_cards2.py` â€” extends the `Hand` class to create a deck, includes `shuffle` and card dealing
* `playing_cards3.py` â€” inheritance with method overriding, cards with different display behavior
* `games.py` â€” module with basic utilities: player class and input functions
* `simple_game.py` â€” simple game using the `games.py` module, creating and displaying players
* `cards.py` â€” module with core card game classes: card, hand, deck
* `blackjack.py` â€” final Blackjack game for 1â€“7 players vs. dealer, uses classes from `cards` and `games` modules
