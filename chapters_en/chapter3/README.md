# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 3 â€” Conditionals and Loops

In Chapter 3, flow control structures are introduced: conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`), logical expressions, `while` loops, as well as the keywords `break` and `continue`.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics

- Conditional statements: `if`, `else`, `elif`
- Comparison operators and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- `while` loops and user input handling
- Working with infinite loops and early exits (`break`, `continue`)
- Basic forms of user interaction
- Using random number generation
