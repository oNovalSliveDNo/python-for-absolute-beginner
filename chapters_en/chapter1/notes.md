# 📝 Notes for Chapter 1 — Getting Started

In this chapter, I learned the basic elements of the Python language. Below are the key concepts and constructs I studied:

## 📚 New Concepts

### 1. `#` — **Comments**  
Used to explain code, ignored by the interpreter.

---

### 2. `print()` — **Output to Console**  
A standard built-in function to display text in the console.  
Example:  
   ```python
   print("Game Over")
````

---

### 3. `input()` — **User Input**

Waits for the user to enter text and press Enter.
Example:

```python
input("\n\nPress Enter to exit.")
```

---

### 4. `"string"` — **String Data Type**

A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. Can contain special characters, such as `\n` (newline).

📌 This chapter provided a general overview of working with Python, running a program, and interacting with the user via the console.
