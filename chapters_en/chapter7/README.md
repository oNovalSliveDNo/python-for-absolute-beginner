# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 7 â€” File Handling and Exception Handling

In this chapter, we explore the basics of working with files in Python â€” how to read and write data, save complex structures using the `pickle` module, and handle errors during program execution.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics

* Reading from a text file using `read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`, and loops
* Writing to a file with `write()` and `writelines()`
* Data serialization using `pickle` and `shelve`
* Exception handling with `try`, `except`, and `else`
* Handling different types of errors and extracting error messages

## ðŸš€ Files

* `read_it.py` â€” demonstration of different methods for reading text files
* `write_it.py` â€” examples of writing text to files
* `pickle_it.py` â€” serializing lists with `pickle` and `shelve`
* `handle_it.py` â€” exception handling: `try/except`, different types of errors, `else`
* `trivia_challenge.py` â€” final project: a text-based quiz using questions from a file
