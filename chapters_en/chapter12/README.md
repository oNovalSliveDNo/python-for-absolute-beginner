# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 12 â€” Basics of Animation and Sound in Python

This chapter covers the basics of animation and working with graphics and sound effects in Python using the **SuperWires** library. Examples include creating moving objects, animating explosions, playing sounds and music (including looping), as well as using keyboard input to control objects on the screen.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics

- Handling keyboard input to move objects on the screen.
- Rotating sprites based on pressed keys.
- Creating animations such as explosions.
- Playing sounds and music, including looping playback.
- Moving objects like asteroids across the screen with collision detection.
- Building gameplay using sprites and animation.
- Implementing a game interface with control elements.

## ðŸš€ Files

- `read_key.py` â€” demonstrates reading key presses to control object movement.
- `rotate_sprite.py` â€” rotates a sprite using keyboard input.
- `explosion.py` â€” creates an explosion animation using a series of images.
- `sound_and_music.py` â€” example of playing sounds and music, including looping.
- `astrocrash01.py` â€” moves asteroids across the screen.
- `astrocrash02.py` â€” continuation of the asteroid project.
- `astrocrash03.py` â€” adds ship movement.
- `astrocrash04.py` â€” adds missile shooting.
- `astrocrash05.py` â€” adds shooting delay for missiles.
- `astrocrash06.py` â€” handles object collisions.
- `astrocrash07.py` â€” adds explosion effects on collision.
- `astrocrash08.py` â€” adds objects for game over conditions.

## âš  Important Note

The original **LiveWires** library is outdated and causes errors:

```python
from livewires import games
````

When attempting to run it, you get an error:

```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'beginners'
```

Therefore, you should use the modern compatible version:

```python
from superwires import games
```

## ðŸ“Œ Running

> Replace the file name with the one you want to run.

```bash
python <file_name>.py
```
