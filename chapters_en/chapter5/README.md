# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 5 â€” Lists, Nested Sequences, and Dictionaries

In this chapter, we explore mutable collections â€” lists and dictionaries. The chapter demonstrates how to work with lists, add and remove elements, sort them, store nested sequences (list of tuples), and work with dictionaries and their basic operations.

## ðŸ§  Main Topics

- Lists: creation, iteration, methods `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.sort()`
- Nested sequences: storing tuples within a list
- Limiting the size of a list (e.g., top-5 records)
- Dictionaries: keys and values, adding, modifying, deleting, checking existence
- `while` loops for building interactive menus
- Using flags for termination (`choice != '0'`)

## ðŸš€ Files

- `hero_inventory_3.py` â€” displaying the contents of an arsenal using a list and `for` loop
- `scores.py` â€” adding, removing, and sorting numeric records in a list
- `scores_2.py` â€” working with nested sequences: records with names
- `geek_translator.py` â€” dictionary of terms: search, add, modify, and delete
- `hangman.py` â€” final project: the classic "Hangman" game with lists, strings, and conditions
