# English Chapters

This folder contains the materials for the English version of the book **"Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner"** by Michael Dawson. The contents of each chapter are organized into subfolders, with code examples, exercises, and notes in English.

## Folder Structure

Each chapter is organized into a separate folder and contains:

- `.py` files — Python code examples from the chapter.
- `README.md` — Description of the chapter's content.
- `notes.md` — My personal notes and explanations (if any).

## Getting Started

To run the examples from this folder, navigate to the appropriate chapter folder and run the corresponding Python file. Please ensure that you are using Python 3.1.1 to avoid compatibility issues with later versions.
